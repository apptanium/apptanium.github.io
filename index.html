                Apptanium brings cloud native, cloud ready apps to the enterprise. The most common hurdle to adopting
                a private cloud (such as Cloud Foundry) or public cloud (such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure)
                is that enterprises have to usually re-write existing applications or create new applications from
                scratch since most legacy applications are not cloud-native and cannot be "lifted and shifted" to the cloud.
                The adoption of a cloud therefore becomes an expensive and time-consuming proposition.
            </p>

            <p class="section-text">
                Apptanium creates cloud native applications that enterprises can adopt directly and start using immediately
                in a cloud of their choice. Apptanium brings standard enterprise requrements like Catalog management,
                Image management, and other value added applications in a cloud-ready deployment model. These apps
                have been written with cloud-native best practices (such as 12 Factor Applications) and allow
                enterprises to rapidly maximize their cloud investments with functioning software.

                Apptanium provides services and apps through a simple licensing model that applies to your entire enterprise.
                It allows your full development organization complete access to the service or app. It also simplifies the
                work the ops team has to do with managing the licensing and deployment of the service or app.

                Apptanium Cloud Data (ACD) provides a generic data fabric backed by a cloud of your choice.
                For on-prem clouds, ACD can use HBase, and for public clouds, ACD can use AWS S3 or Azure Data Storage, depending on the deployment platform.
                ACD is used extensively by other Apptanium services and apps as a generic data fabric which allows those services and apps to migrate seamlessly
                between environments.

                <br/>
                <br/>
                Catalog includes the ability to create products, create multiple 'flavors' of these products (e.g. color, size, texture, etc.),
                add multi-lingual text descriptions for each item, and also control the price and region offerings.
